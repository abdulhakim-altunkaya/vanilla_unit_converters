Angle Units Converter
Why Add It? Angle conversions are useful in mathematics, navigation, astronomy, and engineering, complementing your length and area converters for geometric applications.
Units to Include:
Degree (°)
Radian (rad)
Gradian (grad)
Arcminute (')
Arcsecond (")
Turn (full circle)
Use Case: Useful for navigators, astronomers, or students converting between radians and degrees in trigonometry.
Implementation Notes: Simple conversions (e.g., 1 rad ≈ 57.2957795°, 1 turn = 360°). Ensure precision for small units like arcseconds.
Frequency Units Converter
Why Add It? Frequency is key in physics, audio engineering, and electronics, pairing with your time converter (e.g., for period calculations).
Units to Include:
Hertz (Hz)
Kilohertz (kHz)
Megahertz (MHz)
Gigahertz (GHz)
Revolutions per minute (RPM)
Cycles per second (cps, equivalent to Hz)
Use Case: Useful for engineers working with radio frequencies, musicians analyzing sound, or mechanics calculating RPM.
Implementation Notes: Straightforward conversions (e.g., 1 Hz = 60 RPM, 1 MHz = 10⁶ Hz). Handle high frequencies with appropriate formatting.
